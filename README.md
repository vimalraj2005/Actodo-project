## ⚙️ Getting Started

1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/actodo-project.git
cd actodo-project

---

**2.Install Dependencies**
Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed.

**🌈 Tailwind CSS (Legacy Version) Integration**
This project uses an older version of TailwindCSS.

Installed Tailwind via:

npm install -D tailwindcss@3.4.4 postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p

---

**Configuration**
Make sure tailwind.config.js looks like:

module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,jsx}"],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}

And postcss.config.js:

module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}

Add Tailwind Directives to src/index.css:

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

---

npm start
It will run on http://localhost:3000
